#Brain Segmentation on Magnetic Resonance Images Using U-Net Architecture
* This project explores the application of the U-Net architecture for automatic brain segmentation on MR images, with an emphasis on precise analysis of brain structures in medical diagnostics.
* The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and the BCEDiceLoss loss function, achieving high performance on the BraTS2020 dataset.
* The results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying different brain regions, aiming to reduce human intervention and improve diagnostic accuracy.
* There is room for further improvement of the model in the context of clinical applications.
